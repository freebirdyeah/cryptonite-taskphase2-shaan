# picoCTF: Web Exploitations

_for picoCTF Web Exploitation challenges_

## Cookies

challenge involved the website `http://mercury.picoctf.net:6418/`

On inspecting the website, a prompt was visible which accepted only valid cookie names, I headed to the Applications Tab inside the developers tools and went to the cookies section under Storage. Only one cookie with `Name = 'name'` and `Value =  -1` was visible.

The site checks the prompt at `http://mercury.picoctf.net:6418/check` when it's entered and on entering the default prompt `snickerdoodle`, I noticed the value change to `0`. After editing the value to `1` I saw the name of the cookie on the site changed.

I kept incrementing the cookie value until `Value = 18` which showed me the flag:-

flag: `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_88acab36}`
