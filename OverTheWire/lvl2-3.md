# Level 2 --> 3

After ssh'ing and entering the password received from the previous level.


The goal in this level was to get the password form a file called `spaces in this filename` in the `home` directory.

Obviously, I can't just `cat` it.

I tried running: `~$ cat "spaces in this filename"` which worked and gave me: `MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx`

Got the password to go to the next level, now moving on.
