# Level 1 --> 2


After ssh'ing and entering the password received from the previous level.


Under the "Helpful Reading Material" I saw "Google search for dashed filename", was slightly confused what the deal was so naturally.... I googled.

I found that sometimes dealing with files starting with `-` might be a pain as the filename can be interpreted as a flag.

The goal here was to read a file name `-`, which I found could be done by just explicitly specify the filename by `./-`


On running `~$ cat ./-` I receive the password for the next level: `263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx`


Got the password to go to level 2, now moving on.
