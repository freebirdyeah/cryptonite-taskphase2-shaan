# Level 3 --> 4

After ssh'ing and entering the password received from the previous level.


For getting the password to the next level, the challenge tells us to find the password in a hidden file in a directory called `inhere`.


On a quick `ls` I see the directory and after `cd`ing into it and running `ls -al` I see a file named ` ...Hiding-From-You`

I `cat` it and get: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ


Got the password for the next level, now moving on.
