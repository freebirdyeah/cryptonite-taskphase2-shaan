# Level 4 --> 5

After ssh'ing and entering the password received from the previous level.


The instructions tell us to get the password from the only human-readable text file in the `inhere` directory.
I `cd` into it and run `ls` and see multiple dashed files.

I `cat` each one of them one by one, on `~$ cat ./-file07` I get the password: `4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw`

Got the password for the next level, now moving on.
