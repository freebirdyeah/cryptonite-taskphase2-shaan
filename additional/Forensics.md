# Additional Forensics Challenges

## Blast from the past

Wow, this was annoying. I first used `nano` to edit whatever I could see and it also took me a foolishly long time to understand how the file submission worked in this challenge but in the end I figured it out thanks to: `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78185037/how-to-edit-the-samsung-trailer-tag-timestamp`


I opened my hex editor and went edited the bytes denoting date/time and also those `703` bytes denoting milliseconds (which I figured out by playing with the file's metadata for too long and checking exiftool output), after that the main issue was with the Samsung timestamp:-

```

Checking tag 7/7
Timezones do not have to match, as long as it's the equivalent time.
Looking at Samsung: TimeStamp
Looking for '1970:01:01 00:00:00.001+00:00'
Found: 2023:11:20 20:46:21.420+00:00
Oops! That tag isn't right. Please try again.
```

I figured it out with the help of given link and I just had to replace the time-since-epoch with 1ms to get the flag.

flag: `picoCTF{71m3_7r4v311ng_p1c7ur3_3e336564}`


## Mob psycho

I was given a `.apk` I file, I downloaded it and looked at the first hint which said: `you can unzip .apk files`, on running `unzip` I got a bunch of files and I ran `ls -Ral | grep flag` and I got output saying some `flag.txt` file existed in those files.


I ran `find ~ -name flag.txt` and I got the path to the `flag.txt` file. However on `cat`ing it I realised it was encrypted.

I went over to my trusty `dcoder cipher identifer tool` and decoded it (was in hex) and got the flag.

flag: `picoCTF{ax8mC0RU6ve_NX85l4ax8mCl_a3eb5ac2}`


## PcapPoisoning

I checked the Export Objects section but there was nothing to be extracted from there, On going through the 
packets, I noticed the 3rd packet had the data 'flag is close' I initially thought `gc2VjcmV0OiBwaWNvQ1RGe` to 
be the encoded flag as it was in every packet when I filtered using 'FTP-DATA' but on going through each and 
every packet quickly I noticed one in the end which had the flag.

flag: `picoCTF{P64P_4N4L7S1S_SU55355FUL_4624a8b6}`


## hideme

I couldn't upload the image into Aperisolver but no matter, I researched on basic use of `zsteg` and `binwalk` and ran `zsetg -a flag.png` and got:-

```

```

I saw `secret/flag.png` leading me to suspect there's a file inside the file. I then ran `binwalk -e flag.png` and got:-

```
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             PNG image, 512 x 504, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
41            0x29            Zlib compressed data, compressed

42983         0xA7E7          End of Zip archive, footer length: 22
```

I was then very suprised to find that simple `unzip flag.png` worked, it produced a folder `secret` I `cd`ed 
into it and viewed the flag image.


flag: `picoCTF{Hiddinng_An_imag3_within_@n_imag9_ad9f6587}`

## st3g0

A simple check using `zsteg -a pico.flag.png` was sufficient:-

```
b1,rgb,lsb,xy       .. text: "picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_96ae0ac1}$t3g0"

```

flag: `picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_96ae0ac1}`


## Sleuthkit Intro

I download the `disk.img.gz` file and unzipped it using, `gzip -d disk.img.gz` and then as per the instructions ran `mmls disk.img` and got:-


```
DOS Partition Table
Offset Sector: 0
Units are in 512-byte sectors

      Slot      Start        End          Length       Description
000:  Meta      0000000000   0000000000   0000000001   Primary Table (#0)
001:  -------   0000000000   0000002047   0000002048   Unallocated

```

and the submitted the length of the Linux Partition, to `nc saturn.picoctf.net 58931` and got the flag.

flag: `picoCTF{mm15_f7w!}`


## Lookey here

Very easy: `cat anthem.flag.txt | grep pico`

flag: `picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_58f5c024}`


## m00nwalk 2

Pretty easy as well but this time however there was the annoyance of figuring the password from the image. I did what I did in the OG m00nwalk challenge and used the `sstv` program I downloaded from GitHub to decode the file, it said "there is a hidden message" so I tried using `binwalk` and `zsteg` on the resultant image but found nothing.

I installed the clues audio files and decoded them and the first clue was sufficient, I then used the password given along with `steghide` on the `message.wav` file to get the flag.

```
~$ steghide extract -sf message.wav --passphrase "hidden_stegosaurus"
wrote extracted data to "steganopayload12154.txt".
```

got the flag on `cat`ing it. flag: `picoCTF{the_answer_lies_hidden_in_plain_sight}`

## So Meta

just run exiftool on the image.

flag: `picoCTF{s0_m3ta_fec06741}`
