# Additional Cryptography Challenges

## ReadMyCert

A .csr file was given, I `cat`ed it and saw that it's contents were encrypted in base64. I decoded it 
and found the flag within the decrypted output.

flag: `picoCTF{read_mycert_57f58832}`

## substituion0

I just used dcode.fr 's mono-alphabetic substitution decryptor.

flag: `picoCTF{5UB5717U710N_3V0LU710N_357BF9FF}`
