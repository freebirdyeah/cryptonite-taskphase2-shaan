# Day 8: Shellcodes of the world, unite!


<del>
Before trying anything here's what I understand from the instructions:-

1. Shellcode: some code written to inject commands, delivered through various means.

2. Powershell is used as an exploitation tool

3. We can bypass Windows Defender by obsfucation or loading code directly into memory to bypass signature-based detection (probably a database of already known threats)

4. Windows API is often relied upon to carry out exploits due to it's ability to interact with crucial system operations.

5. PowerShell Reflection allows attackers to call Windows API functions directly at runtime helping in executing code successfully.

6. Reverse Shell: Basically the victim machine establishes a connection with the attacking machine and from there we work (roles switch)

THIS JUST REFUSES TO WORK ON MY MACHINE, POWERSHELL KEEPS CRASHING. UNSOLVABLE.
